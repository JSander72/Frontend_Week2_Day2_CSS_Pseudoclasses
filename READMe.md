# CSS Pseudoclasses

Tailoring interaction and style
In the tapestry of web design, CSS pseudoclasses act as the delicate stitches that bring dynamic interaction and nuanced styling to the fabric of our pages. These special selectors allow us to tailor styles based on an element's state, user actions, or place in the DOM hierarchy, adding layers of depth and interactivity to the user experience.
